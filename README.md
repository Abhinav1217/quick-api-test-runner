# quick-api-test-runner
Sometimes you don't need a full suite of api test runner like postman or hoppscotch, but just a simple call it and log response. This is just that.

## 
Only dependency is NodeJS and Axios. I have personally replaced this with BunJs for personal use but this is being uploaded to be shared among my juniors to help them brute testing their application.

```
$ pnpm i

$ node .\example.api-test.js
